# Bond-s-Adventures
The game is basically an adventure text-based game, based on the framework of ‘The Word of Zuul Adventure’. The player embodies James Bond, a high level agent which is appointed to complete a high-risk mission for the sake of the CIA. The mission consist of finding and killing a well known murderer in a house. Thus, the map of the game consists of common types of rooms that you can find in a house. In total, there are 10 rooms and 3 floors. Kryzko, the serial-killer, is sleeping in a locked room, while his guard is moving around the house to watch-out for any intruder. There are a total of 8 items spread among all rooms. They can vary from common objects (i.e tv, paint, keys, knife), to weapons (i.e gun, ammo, poison). James Bond is carrying with him a backpack that serves as the player’s inventory. However, he can carry with him up to a certain limited amount of weight (in the game it is set to 1600 grams), to be the lightest and the fastest possible. Therefore, the player should be careful on the usefulness of the items he takes. At the beginning of the game, James Bond has no weapon on him, and thus, the player should find weapons in the house before being found by the guard, otherwise the game is lost. As it is a text-based game, the game is played through commands entered by the player. The game recognizes a list of well defined commands that can be shown using the ‘help’ command.
